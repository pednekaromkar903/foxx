## Deployment (Vercel)
To deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel:
1. Ensure the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable is set to your production Express backend URL in Vercel project settings.
2. The monorepo setup dictates setting the root directory to `apps/web`.
3. The build command is natively picked up by Vercel (`npm run build`).
